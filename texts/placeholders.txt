<br>"For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God."


#church-community
At Goshen International Church Ministries, we hold a deep conviction that the Church is not just a building or a gathering, but a vibrant and diverse community of believers. 
We believe in the power of fellowship, mutual support, and shared faith that unites us as members of the body of Christ.

#serving
Just as Christ came to serve rather than be served, we believe in serving our community and the world around us. 
Through acts of compassion, outreach programs, and partnerships with local organizations, we seek to make a positive impact and show Christ's love in practical ways.


#ministry
In our worship services and ministries, we come together to praise and honor God. We recognize that each member of the body has unique gifts and talents, and we encourage active participation and involvement in the various ministries that contribute to the well-being of our community and the advancement of God's Kingdom.

#purpose_church
The Church is more than an institution; it's a living organism established by God Himself. Our purpose as the Church is to be a light in the world, reflecting the love and grace of Christ to everyone around us. 
We are called to be a community that worships God, grows together in faith, and extends His love to our neighbors and beyond.
